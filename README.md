# Watiseropderadio API ```v1.0.6```
**Warning: this project is still a work in progress**

Some people think that *open-source* will kill their business. We don't. We have build this API on top of other *open-source* software like [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [Sails.js](http://sailsjs.org/) and [dokku](http://progrium.viewdocs.io/dokku/).

## Usage
If you want to use this API, please get in contact with us. We have contact options on [watiseropderadio.nl](http://watiseropderadio.nl). There are limits on usage of our API. If you use this API without a valid *API-key* it is not unlikely that you get banned after *x* requests.
